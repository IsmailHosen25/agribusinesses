# 🌾 Agribusinesses Management System (DBMS Project)

A data-driven management system designed to streamline operations for an agricultural business, focusing on inventory, supply chain, and employee data management. This project was developed to apply and demonstrate **advanced Database Management System (DBMS)** principles.

## ⚙️ Project Highlights

* **Database Design:** **Normalized relational schema** (3NF or higher) designed to eliminate data redundancy and ensure **data integrity**.
* **Complex Queries:** Implemented stored procedures and complex **JOIN** queries to generate key reports (e.g., calculating annual profit margin, identifying low-stock items).
* **Backend Interface:** Utilized **[PHP/Java/Node.js]** to create a secure API layer for interacting with the database.
* **User Management:** Role-based access control implemented to distinguish between administrators, employees, and suppliers.
* **Technology Focus:** Emphasizes **[SQL/NoSQL]** proficiency and the application of relational theory.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Database:** [MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server]
* **Backend Language:** [PHP/Java/Node.js]
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for dashboard visualization)

## 📖 Database Schema Overview

The system manages key entities: **Products, Suppliers, Inventory, Employees, and Sales Orders.**
[Optionally, include a simple ASCII or Mermaid diagram of your core tables and relationships]

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

1.  **Database Setup:**
    * Install **[MySQL/PostgreSQL]** and create a new database named `agribusiness_db`.
    * Import the schema file: `[path/to/schema.sql]`
2.  **Application Configuration:**
    * Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/IsmailHosen25/agribusinesses.git`
    * Update the database connection string in `[config/db.js or similar file]`.
3.  **Start the Server:**
    ```bash
    cd agribusinesses
    npm start # Or relevant start command
    ```
